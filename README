This client provides:

 o high level, simple object oriented interface to cassandra
 o failover behavior on the client side
 o connection pooling for improved performance and scalability
 o load balancing

Current TO DOs:

 o Get it to compile
 o Refactor interfaces to conform to .net conventions
 o Evaluate high-level API interface - optimize for usability
	o Make connection pooling transparent to user api
 o Provide configuration system
 o Convert client monitor to perf counters?
 o Port legacy java unit tests
 o write some docs on how to get cassandra working on Windows

If you are interested in contributing, let us know.

The work was initially inspired by http://code.google.com/p/cassandra-java-client/ but has taken off to different 
directions since.

The original Java version of this port is available at http://github.com/rantav/hector
